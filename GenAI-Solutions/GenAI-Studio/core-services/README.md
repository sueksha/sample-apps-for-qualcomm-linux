# Core Services Layout

## Canonical Service Paths

All services are located under the `core-services/` directory structure:

- `core-services/text-to-text`
- `core-services/image-to-text`
- `core-services/text-to-image`
- `core-services/speech-to-text`
- `core-services/text-to-speech`
- `core-services/orchestrator`

**Note:** Legacy service folders at the repository root have been consolidated. All service sources and configurations are now maintained exclusively within `core-services/`. References in scripts, documentation, and deployment commands must use only the `core-services/*` canonical paths.

## Service Map

| Service | Source Directory | Dockerfile | Main Documentation | Model Setup | Port |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text-to-Text | `core-services/text-to-text` | `core-services/text-to-text/Dockerfile` | `core-services/text-to-text/README.md` | `core-services/text-to-text/MODEL_SETUP.md` | 8088 |
| Image-to-Text | `core-services/image-to-text` | `core-services/image-to-text/Dockerfile` | `core-services/image-to-text/README.md` | `core-services/image-to-text/MODEL_SETUP.md` | 8080 |
| Text-to-Image | `core-services/text-to-image` | `core-services/text-to-image/Dockerfile` | `core-services/text-to-image/README.md` | `core-services/text-to-image/MODEL_SETUP.md` | 8084 |
| Speech-to-Text | `core-services/speech-to-text` | `core-services/speech-to-text/Dockerfile` | `core-services/speech-to-text/README.md` | `core-services/speech-to-text/MODEL_SETUP.md` | 8081 |
| Text-to-Speech | `core-services/text-to-speech/meloTTS` | `core-services/text-to-speech/meloTTS/Dockerfile` | `core-services/text-to-speech/meloTTS/README.md` | `core-services/text-to-speech/meloTTS/Model-Generation.md` | 8083 |
| Orchestrator | `core-services/orchestrator` | `core-services/orchestrator/Dockerfile` | `core-services/orchestrator/README.md` | `core-services/orchestrator/SETUP.md` | 8090 |

## Private SDK Build Contexts

These are staged on target inside the repo checkout:

- STT SDK payload:
  - `core-services/speech-to-text/whisper_sdk`
- TTS SDK payload:
  - `core-services/text-to-speech/meloTTS/melo_sdk`
  - optional archive alternative: `core-services/text-to-speech/meloTTS/1.1.1.0.zip`

## Shared Files Outside `core-services`

These stay at repo root because they are shared by multiple services:

- `docker-compose.yml`
- `Dockerfile.runtime`
- `Dockerfile.build-base`
- `Dockerfile.base`
- `README.md`

Shared setup docs now live under `docs/setup/`.

Use `README.md` as the main onboarding path.
